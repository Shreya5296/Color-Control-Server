# Color-Control-Server

1. Take the following required components from the kit.
● 1 x Breadboard
● 1 x RGB LED
● 3 x 330-ohm resistor
● 1 x ESP32
● 1 x USB Programming Cable
● 5 x Male to Male Jumper wires

2. Insert the RGB LED, resistor and the ESP32 in the breadboard.
   
3. Make connections between the RGB LED, resistor and the ESP32 using male to male jumper wire. By doing this step, your hardware is ready.
   
4. In the project template, write appropriate code, so that you can :
a) Connect your ESP32 with the wifi.
b) Make a webserver on ESP32, so that it can listen to client requests.
c) Control the RGB LED colors as requested by the client.
